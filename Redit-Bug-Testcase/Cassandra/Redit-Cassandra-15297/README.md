### Description

We make snapshot through "nodetool snapshot -t snapshotname " , when snapshotname contains special characters like "/", the make snapshot process successfully , but the result
can be different ,when we check the data file directory or use "nodetool listsnapshots".
here is some case :

1. nodetool snapshot -t "p/s"
The listsnapshot resturns snapshot p for all table but actually the snapshot name is "p/s"; also the data directory is like the format : datapath/snapshots/p/s/snapshot-datafile-link

2. nodetool snapshot -t "/"
The listsnapshot resturns "there is not snapshot"; but the make snapshot process return successfully and the data directory is like the format : datapath/snapshots/snapshot-datafile-link

The Attachements are the result under our environment. So for me , we suggest that the snapshot name should not contains special character. just throw exception and told the user not to use special character.

### Testcase

Reproduced version：3.11.6

Steps to reproduce：

1. Create and set snapshots for all keyspaces through nodetool, the address is "p/s".
2. Check the snapshot through "bin/nodetool listsnapshots", and find that the snapshot name is p, and its actual snapshot address is "data_file + /snapshots/p/s".
