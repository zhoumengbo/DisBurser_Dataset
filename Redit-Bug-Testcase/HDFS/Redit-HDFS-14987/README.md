### Description

EC file blockId location info displaying as "null" with hdfs fsck -blockId command

Check the blockId information of an EC enabled file with "hdfs fsck -blockId"  Check the blockId information of an EC enabled file with "hdfs fsck -blockId"    blockId location related info will display as null,which needs to be rectified.    

- Check the attachment "EC_file_block_info"

- Check the output of a normal file block to compare

Actual Output :-     null   
Expected output :- It should display the blockId location related info as (nodes, racks) of the block  as specified in the usage info of fsck -blockId option.                 [like : Block replica on datanode/rack: BLR10000xx038/default-rack is HEALTHY]

### Testcase

Reproduced version：3.1.2

Steps to reproduce：
1. Create two test folders in hdfs, and set their erasure coding policies to XOR-2-1-1024k and Replicate respectively.
2. Pass in a txt file in each of the two files.
3. Obtain the blockId of the file storage.
4. Through /bin/hdfs fsck checks the block information separately, and the results are as follows:

```
$ /hadoop/hadoop-3.1.2/bin/hdfs fsck /test_ec/aa.txt -blockId blk_-9223372036854775792

Block Id: blk_-9223372036854775792
Block belongs to: /test_ec/aa.txt
No. of Expected Replica: 2
No. of live Replica: 2
No. of excess Replica: 0
No. of stale Replica: 2
No. of decommissioned Replica: 0
No. of decommissioning Replica: 0
No. of corrupted Replica: 0
null

Fsck on blockId 'blk_-9223372036854775792


$ /hadoop/hadoop-3.1.2/bin/hdfs fsck /test_replica/aa.txt -blockId blk_1073741825

Block Id: blk_1073741825
Block belongs to: /test_replica/aa.txt
No. of Expected Replica: 3
No. of live Replica: 3
No. of excess Replica: 0
No. of stale Replica: 3
No. of decommissioned Replica: 0
No. of decommissioning Replica: 0
No. of corrupted Replica: 0
Block replica on datanode/rack: dn3/default-rack is HEALTHY
Block replica on datanode/rack: dn2/default-rack is HEALTHY
Block replica on datanode/rack: dn1/default-rack is HEALTHY
```
